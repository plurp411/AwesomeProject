Do each of the following excercises in 30 second intervals each, switching from one into the next, doing each exercise a total of 4 times. Most important is not how many of each you do, but that you don't stop.

### 1. Crunches

#### How do I get in position?

Lay on your back with your legs outstretched. Then lift your feet off of the ground and bring your knees in toward your body. Keep your thighs almost vertical, creating a 90 degree angle with your body.

#### How do I do it?

Simply place both of your hands behind your head, and use your core to lift your upper body up to get as close as you can to meeting your knees. Go slowly and try to hold yourself at the top of each crunch for an extra burn on your abs.

### 2. Bicycle Kicks

#### How do I get in position?

Stay in the position that you were in for crunches with your feet and knees lifted up. Then just place both of your hands flat under your lower back.

#### How do I do it?

Just pretend that your are riding a bike, though exaggerating the motion may help you. Remember to keep both your back and head flat on the ground the entire time.

### 3. Planks

#### How do I get in position?

Lay on your stomach and lift yourself off the ground so that you are supporting yourself with only your forearms while your toes rest on the ground. Make sure to keep your back straight and your hhead off of the ground and looking forward.

#### How do I do it?

Hold yourself in this position, keeping your core tight. If you are unable to hold this position for the full 30 seconds, you may want to try supporting yourself with your hands and keeping your arms straight, similar to the position of a push up.
